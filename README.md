# TwitterBot
This bot was written for a project in DICE 3010 at Seattle University by Bryan Barrows. 

It is designed to ping the CoinMarketCap Pro API every 30 minutes. 

If the price of BitCoin has changed by more than 5% in the span of an hour, day, or week, the bot tweets an alert about the change and current price.

If there hasn't been a movement in price of 5% or more, the bot just tweets current price (in USD).
